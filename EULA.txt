4 Restrictions

4.1 Licensee shall not or permit another to (i) modify, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or create derivative works of the Software; (ii) disassemble, decompile, reverse-engineer, or attempt to discover or derive source code of the Software, except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this restriction; (iii) rent, sell, lease, lend, sublicense, provide commercial hosting services involving the Software, or in any other way allow third parties to exploit the Software; (iv) modify, circumvent, deactivate, degrade, or thwart any software-based or hardware-based protection mechanism Zebra has in place to safeguard the Software; (v) use, remove, alter, or obscure any of Zebra’s trademarks, trade names, logos, or service marks without prior written consent from Zebra; or (vi) embed any virus, Trojan horse, worm, backdoor, shutdown mechanism, malicious code, sniffer, bot, drop dead mechanism, or spyware or other software, code, or program that is likely to or is intended to have an adverse impact on the performance of, disable, corrupt, cause damage to, cause or facilitate unauthorized access to, or deny authorized access to any software, hardware, network, services, systems, data, or Zebra products.
